### Grading

* Assignments = 10% of total lab grade (each graded individually and separately, no 'collective' assignments)
* Test 1 - 20%
* Test 2 - 25%
* Test 3 - 25%
* Test 4 - 20%


### Administrative

Max number of absences = 1 (NOT applicable for test days)
Assignments will be given dynamic feedback through GIT and will be graded only after one says he/she is thoroughly done with it.
Only assignments which are pushed to GIT will be graded and taken into consideration.
