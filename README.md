### Grading

* Assignments = 10% of total lab grade (each graded individually and separately, no 'collective' assignments)
* Test 1 - 20%
* Test 2 - 25%
* Test 3 - 25%
* Test 4 - 20%


### Administrative

* Max number of absences = 1 (NOT applicable for test days - if you miss a test day, you'll have to take the test separately, problem will be more difficult)
* Assignments will be given dynamic feedback through GIT and will be graded only after one says he/she is thoroughly done with it.
* Only assignments which are pushed to GIT will be graded and taken into consideration.
* "Extra credit" assignments can only be completed by those who already have completed the 'normal' assignments. They will be even more thoroughly inspected and evaluated.

### About tests

* Grades range: 1-10
* Code does not even compile: 1 (by default, no excuses)
* For every warning: -0.25 on the grade - your code should be clean enough to surpass any Codeblocks warnings
* Cheating attempts: 1 (by default, no excuses)
* Work will be copied to USB stick and will be graded in maximum 48 hours
* Results on GIT - check grades.xls file in every group folder


### GIT Tutorials

* 1 - [Installing GIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZNYfbXnpXQ&list=PLxDrAnoepRN2OXJ4boGqPF0LIADjWGqe7&index=1)
* 2 - [Fork and Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJQAfbARvMI&index=2&list=PLxDrAnoepRN2OXJ4boGqPF0LIADjWGqe7)
* 3 - [Commit Push and Pull Request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPq0yClIDhM&index=3&list=PLxDrAnoepRN2OXJ4boGqPF0LIADjWGqe7)


### Interesting Stuff

* [Generic Lists](https://github.com/AC-2015-Sem2/DSA-lab/tree/master/Interesting%20Stuff/GenericLists) more exactly, how to create a (reusable) node which can remain the same for most of the functionality of the list regardless of the problem to be solved?
* [Pointers to functions](https://github.com/AC-2015-Sem2/DSA-lab/tree/master/Interesting%20Stuff/PointersToFunctions) a cute example of how you can use a structure to simulate OOP behaviour.



### Catalysts Coding Contest

* Anyone who chooses to participate in the [Catalysts Coding Contest](https://www.facebook.com/events/397457320436013/) (<-- LINK) will be awarded 0.3 points to the final mark
* For every level successfully completed (with or without a team) an additional 0.1 points will be added to everyone in the team (or to the solo participant) up to a total of 0.7 points if you somehow manage to complete all 7 levels
* If you manage to be in the top 10 contestants you will get an additional 1 point to the final grade
* Don't forget - free pizza and drinks at the end!
* Helpful hint #1: the first two levels are terribly simple most of the times
* Helpful hint #2: you sample a few problems [here](http://contest.catalysts.cc/en/) (<-- LINK)
